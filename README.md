# Frontend

The frontend is a React webapp, and will communicate with the backend via an API.

## Developing Frontend

1. Uninstall any old version of NodeJS and install NodeJS 22.12 LTS from https://nodejs.org/en/download/package-manager.
 
2. Check with `node --version` that you have node 22.12 installed and with `npm --version` that you have npm 10.9.0 installed.

3. In a terminal, cd into the `frontend` folder and run `npm install` to grab all the packages.

4. Run `npm run dev` to start up the frontend, and open the link to the local website.

When you make changes and save the file, the website will automatically re-compile and update in your browser.
